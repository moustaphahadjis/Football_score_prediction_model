# 🌍 International Football Score Prediction Model

This project aims to forecast the outcomes of international football matches based on historical FIFA score data. ⚽

We've employed Poisson distribution, KNN, and MLP classifiers to craft our solution. However, it's worth noting that this project represents an initial attempt at tackling a complex problem, and there's room for improvement to enhance accuracy:

- Incorporating player valuation 🌟
- Factoring in the significance of match venues 🏟️
- Analyzing the formations of both teams 🔄
- Evaluating player form 💪
- And more 📊

Overall, with the dataset used in this study, we achieved a 69% accuracy rate in predicting the winning side. 📈

To further enhance performance, we can explore employing DNN techniques to increase the model's understanding of various factors. 🧠

This project was conducted using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with data sourced from MART JÜRISOO's "International football results from 1872 to 2023" dataset, available on [www.kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com/). 🖥️📊
